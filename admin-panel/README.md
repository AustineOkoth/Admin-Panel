The main goal of this project was to put my practice on interacting with React.js
I learned abot the ES6 syntax, React useEffect, React useState, React routers, and other react necessities including interaction with other js libraries like chart.js have been applied in this project.

The use of node.js and express.js server has also been implemented in the project (Found under the Server Folder.)


I was able to come up with a great user interface to be used by a company that deals with messaging.

The user Interface is attractive and well designed (As you will or have allready seen )

If you wish to interact with this project, ensure that you have imported the onionmedia.sql attached to this project. The dummy data filled in the database you are free to manipulate it to your own preference.

****NB Ensure that you start the Express Server found in the Server folder *******

*** Incase of deployment ensure that the url are changed to your preference****

*** { "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" } is located in package.json folder and its responsible for handling the request coming from the express server. Ensure you change it to your preference incase the port your using is busy ***

I haven`t focused on media queries so I would suggest you open the project from a 
Personal Computer (PC) with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels (Though its still well of
in PC's with slightly smaller or slightly larger resolutions)
